# Test Installation

Create a new app:

```
rails new testapp
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 `testapp` is the name of the Rails project
{% endhint %}

Once you see a 'Done in xxxs' message and that Webpacker has been installed successfully, run the rails server:

```bash
cd testapp #move into the app directory
rails server
```

If it's working properly, [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) will show the Rails homepage.
