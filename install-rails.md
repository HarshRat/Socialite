# Install Rails

Install rails as a gem:

```
gem install rails
```

Whenever you install a new version of Ruby or a gem that provides commands, you should run the `rehash` sub-command. This will install _shims_ for all Ruby executables known to rbenv, which will allow you to use the executables:

```text
rbenv rehash
```
